A leading financial bank is aiming to broaden the financial inclusion of the unbanked population by proving a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to better understand what makes a positive loan-experience or possible challenges in providing a good loan service, the bank is focusing on using diverse and a large amount of data sets, including but not limited to telco and transactional information. The overall goal is to predict the clientsâ€™ repayment abilities in relation to their banking characteristics. 

Through data analysis and using the results, the bank is planning to develop a new financial service where the clients who are capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar. The new service envisioned to empower the clients to be successful in paying back their loans.
