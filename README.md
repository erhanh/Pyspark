Implementing Machine Learninig Applications in Pyspark environment: Financial Case
Case Statement
A leading financial bank is trying to broaden the financial inclusion for the unbanked population by proving a positive and safe borrowing experience. In order to make sure this underserved population has a positive loan experience; it makes use of variety of alternative data—including telco and transactional information—to predict their clients’ repayment abilities.
The problem is to develop a solution to ensure that the clients capable of repayment are not rejected and that loans are given with a principal, maturity, and repayment calendar that will empower their clients to be successful.
